We've been busy since we first started working on the Executive Prominent Alzheimer's Disease project with Dr. Paul Crane's research team.  We've spent a lot of time getting to know these wonderful team members and their research processes and couldn't be more happier with belonging to this group!

Our long term goal is to aid in placing a well-documented, easily findable record of the research details in a public repository.  Along the way, we've used our librarian skills to assist the team in day to day activities such as building a team reference library, conducting literature searches for new research avenues, and providing informational support for grant proposals.

As always, we are alert for opportunities to add value to our services.  In an exciting new development, we have been tasked with developing a visualization assessing the co-authorship network that has resulted from a series of annual  workshops that our PI is involved in.  We've consulted our gifted colleague, Stephen Gabrielson, who came up with a network graph.  We've broken up the tasks: obtaining bibliographic data, cleaning and processing the data, graphing the data.  We are excited to produce our initial draft!
