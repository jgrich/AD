 Paul Crane, Professor, General Internal Medicine, reacted to the NLM Administrative Supplement by initiating contact with the UW Health Sciences Librarians to put forth a proposal to fund informationist services for his Alzheimer's Disease research team.  The NLM proposal was not funded, nevertheless he persisted and successfully secured an Administrative Supplement through the National Institutes on Aging.
 We joined the research team when they were in Year 1 of their grant funding. Then we began exploring ways to provide meaningful service to the group.
